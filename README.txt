In the following files I have posted my code for the Reed College CSCI Algorithms class.
Some of the base code was written by the professor, Eric Zornik. My additions are signified by a heavy use of commenting when not explicitly marked.
Week 1 has insertion sort build/testing. 
Week 3 has building pascals triangle, finding reducible words, measuring weights, and an intro attempt at the stock cutting problem.
Week 4 has recursion, bernoulli numbers counting squares in a grid, and a divide-and-conquer algorithm for determining species.
Week 5 has ring-buffer deques, linked-list deques, and a test file testing both. 
Week 7 has AVL trees, a tree balancing script, and work on priority queues.
Week 9 has knuth-morris-pratt algotiyhm, and boyer-moore implementation.
Week 10 has implemetnation of union-find for a maze algorithm and huffman tree practice.
Week 11 has graph scripts with adding/removing arcs and nodes, and an algorithm for topological sort.
Week 12 has Dijkstra's algorithm, and floyd-warshall implemenation.
